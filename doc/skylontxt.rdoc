Skylon:

Introducing the all new Skylon
100% new design featuring a one-piece monobloc RTM construction

Balanced and dynamic:
Increasing rigidity with monobloc chainsays while improving comfort using Vectran vibration-filteration fibers throughout the frame

Aerodynamic
Developed with numeric simulations and wind tunnel test performed with pro cyclist Jerome Coppel

Available early 2015


100% New Design - started from a blank slate.

    <h2>Road Pedals</h2>
<p>TIME has revolutionized clipless pedal technology and introduces its newest generation: Xpresso</p>
<p>This brand new pedal has an even faster, more intuitive engagement without any rubbing, which is thanks to the Iclic concept of a pre-open clipless system (TIME patent).</p>
<p>The use of a carbon flexion blade instead of the traditional metal spring allows for these new pedals to be extremely light.</p>
<p>Oversize 700 mm2 pedal platform gives the pedals a record surface area/weight factor.</p>
